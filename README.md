This project is a Django CRUD Application based on the excellent tutorial laid oud in Eric Mattes  Python Crash Course Volume 3: [Book Link](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1718502702/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_1/355-6195773-4736419?pd_rd_w=JjS5J&content-id=amzn1.sym.855d8f70-df76-4181-80b0-56e48ae3bb9b&pf_rd_p=855d8f70-df76-4181-80b0-56e48ae3bb9b&pf_rd_r=GDTPGQKV645FJCF2V1W0&pd_rd_wg=T4Ude&pd_rd_r=84b51ac4-ac4f-4a3f-a041-3e89583e02d4&pd_rd_i=1718502702&psc=1)



The same basic structure is the same, but with additions and expansions.

The accounts section has additional password reset, and you have the ability to delete entries and topics as well. Also, we’ve implemented a proper mail delivery system through the Anymail package. Further, we’re using Django-Tailwind to handle all of our styling. 

Of course, the theme of the application is different from the tutorial, as here we are recording memories in a journal rather than things we’ve learned in a log. 

This is still a work in progress as an application and the next stage is to do some more interesting things with the UI and to eventually have the ability to add multimedia. 

Please stay tuned for further updates.
